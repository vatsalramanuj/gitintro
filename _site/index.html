<h2 id="hi-im-vatsal">Hi, I’m Vatsal</h2>

<p>I’m an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering with interests in <strong>Radio Frequency communication, antenna design, and applied programming</strong>.<br />
I am especially interested in the intersection regions of electronics, physics, and computing.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p>Some of my interesting GitHub projects are listed here:</p>

<h3 id="digit-recognizer">Digit Recognizer</h3>
<p>A web-based digit recognition app built with a <strong>Flask</strong> frontend, and an <strong>ML backend (using NumPy)</strong>. It includes implementation for forward propagation, gradient descent followed by backpropagation and is trained on the MNIST dataset. Hosted on Render, it is 
<em><a href="https://digitrecognizer-o7lh.onrender.com/">deployed for interactive handwritten digit prediction.</a></em>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="timetable-maker">Timetable Maker</h3>
<p>An <strong>automatic timetable generator</strong> for students from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. This was useful to many peers, juniors and seniors for linking their classes seamlessly to their Google Calendars. I got overwhelmingly positive reviews about easy usage and effective planning support from my peers uning the calendar. The web app takes inputs of course names, their slots and classrooms to give a .ics file that can be imported in Google Calendar directly. Its <em><a href="https://timetable-maker-o7kb.onrender.com/">deployed here.</a></em></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="games">Games</h3>
<p>Some of my favorite projects are building games for myself. My favorite game growing up was <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiloo.subwaysurf&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;pli=1">SYBO Games’ Subway Surfers</a> and thus my games are inspired by this obstacle dodging mechanic. There are 2 versions of this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A command line based fast-paced console arcade game where you dodge falling obstacles using ASCII graphics and colors.</li>
  <li>A face tracking based game with more involved mechanic including collecting coins, dodging obstacles, and using powerups to achieve the highest score possible!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>You can find more projects and my professional experience in my resume. Aside from professional pursuits, you can find me looking through a telescope, playing my guitar, or solving LinkedIn puzzles.</p>
