## Projects
Some of my GitHub interesting projects are listed here:

### Digit Recognizer
A web-based digit recognition app built with a **Flask** frontend, and an **ML backend (NumPy only)**. It includes implementation for forward propagation, gradient descent followed by backpropagation and is trained on the MNIST dataset. Hosted on Render, it is 
*[deployed for interactive handwritten digit prediction.](https://digitrecognizer-o7lh.onrender.com/)* You can check it out!

### Timetable Maker
An **automatic timetable generator** that for students from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras; this was useful to many peers, juniors and seniors for linking their classes seamlessly to their Google Calendars. Their reviews were that it saved their time and also helped them plan other commitments more effectively. The web app takes inputs of course names, their slots and classrooms to give a .ics file that can be imported in Google Calendar directly.

### Games
The best projects are the ones that are fun and what is more fun than building a **game** for yourselves! My favorite game growing up was [SYBO Games' Subway Surfers](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiloo.subwaysurf&hl=en_IN&pli=1) and thus my games are inspired by this obstacle dodging mechanic. There are 2 versions of this:
- A command line based fast-paced console arcade game where you dodge falling obstacles using ASCII graphics and colors. 
- A face tracking based game with more involved mechanic including collecting coins, dodging obstacles, and using powerups to achieve the highest score possible!
